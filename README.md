## 🎮 About the Project

**«The Government Inspector»** — is my first **visual novel**, developed using the **Ren'Py** engine. It is based on the immortal satirical comedy by **Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol**, reimagined in an interactive format: the player assumes the role of **Alexandrovich Khlestakov** and experiences the key events of this remarkable story.

The project includes:
- an adapted version of the original literary text,
- visual design generated using **Stable Diffusion**,
- support for **мобильные устройства и браузеры**,
- a complete build published on **Itch.io**.
